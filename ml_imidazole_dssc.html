    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
        This scientific paper presents a novel approach to explore and predict the potential of imidazole-based organic dyes for use in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) using a machine learning web application. The design of efficient and cost-effective organic dyes is critical to enhance the performance of DSSCs. Traditional experimental methods are time-consuming and resource-intensive, making it challenging to screen a large number of potential dyes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In this study, we propose a machine learning-based approach to accelerate the discovery process by predicting the photovoltaic performance of imidazole-based organic dyes. Machine learning predictions provide valuable insights into the expected PCE% and behaviors of the molecules toward DSSCs. Based on the RDKit library, several fingerprints such as Molecular ACCess System (MACCS), Avalon (Av), Daylight, Pharmacophore, and Morgan with different radius (r2, r3, r4) were studied. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, more than 20 ML algorithms using different cross-validation (3, 5, 7, 10) were also evaluated. Among these, Deep Neural Network (DNN) models of MLPRegressor algorithm based on the Daylight fingerprint show a significant coefficient of determination combined with the lowest errors. Utilizing the trained ML models to screen 50 million SMILE structures for identifying promising imidazole derivatives as donor groups, significant improvements in PCE were observed, increasing from 7.70% to as high as 11.49%, representing nearly a 50% enhancement over the control.
    </p>
    <p>
        This result provides a promising pathway for developing new dye materials that can push the efficiency limits of DSSCs, leading to more efficient solar energy conversion technologies in the future. In addition, a developed web application offers a user-friendly interface for researchers to input their molecular structures and obtain PCE% predictions toward DSSCs. This information can guide researchers in designing new imidazole compounds with high photovoltaic performance to validate and refine the predictions without time-consuming efforts.
